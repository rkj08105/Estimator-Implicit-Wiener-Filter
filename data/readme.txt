

In this project, two speech samples are taken from each clean and noisy files.

1) sp25.wav - clean speech sample spoken by a male speaker
Sentence- A good book informs of what we ought to know

2) sp30.wav - clean speech sample spoken by a female speaker
Sentence- Let us all join as we sing the last chorus

3) 2 SNRs are used for creating noisy speech samples- 0dB, and 5dB.

4) 6 Noises are added- babble, car, street, train, airport, restaurant

Speech samples (both clean and noisy) are at 8kHz.

For illustration, we have taken one noisy speech sample "sp30_train_sn5".
This means the clean speech sample sp30.wav is added with train noise 
at 5dB SNR to make a noisy speech.
